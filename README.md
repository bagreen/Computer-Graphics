# Computer-Graphics
Code from my Computer Graphics class in C

## Lab 1
Lab 1 is a lab where we have to create a method that fills a polygon of various sizes. You are given the coordinates in x and y, and the length, and you must fill in the polygon. 

## Lab 2
Lab 2 is a lab where we have to display an \*.xy image, and rotate the image. This involved processing command line arguments and reading files, and then using matrix multiplication to rotate and center the image. 

## Lab 3
Lab 3 is a lab where we have to have a user click points on the screen, and then only display the image within those coordinates. This builds on lab 2, and only works for drawn convex shapes. 

## Lab 4
Lab 4 is a lab where we have to display three dimensional images instead of two dimensional. This involved \*.xyz files, and using matrix multiplication to display these images. 

## Lab 5
Lab 5 is a lab where we have to build off of lab 4, but not show the back faces of the shapes. This means calculating the normal vector of each polygon, and calculating the vector to the viewer to see if it is on the back of a polygon or not. This method is not perfect, but mostly works. 

## Lab 6
Lab 6 is a lab where we have to take all polygons in a shape, sort them, and print them back to front so that this solves the issues in lab 5. 

## Lab 7
Lab 7 is a lab where we have to take lab 6, but add color to it and calculate the shade of color based on the orientation to the light source.
